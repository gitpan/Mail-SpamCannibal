	ns.c, rework the order of database interrogation for lookups
	of black list addresses. The old way produced three database hits 
	as the norm, this has been reduced to two.

0.11  Tue Sep  9 18:00:28 PDT 2003
	main.c -- modified the child network socket loop to fix a timing 
	problem when interrogating the dnsbls from the local host via bind.

	modify rc.dnsbls so that record 127.0.0.2 is 
	forceably added without user intervention.

0.10  Tue Sep  2 21:04:13 PDT 2003
	Revert -M option -- this turns out to be unneeded
	Add -N option for naming the localhost DNS object
	Correct error in mungemacros.c where buffer size constraint
	was MSGsize instead of IP_MAXPACKET
	Add lookup in the evidence file to ns.c. Evidence must be
	consulted before blcontrib to prevent non-reporting of 
	127.0.0.2 'A' records if they appear in both blcontrib and evidence.

0.09  Mon Sep  1 15:32:36 PDT 2003
	Add -M masquerade option to main.c, host_info.c

	zone name and designated IP address from the command line

	Modify ns.c to disallow response codes outside
	the range of 127.0.0.3 => 127.255.255.255 for
	the blcontrib database. This will prevent
	feedback loops from developing among cooperating
	promiscious DNSBL servers
