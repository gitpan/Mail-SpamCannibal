"  -?	: Print this help information\n"
"Note 1:\n"
"  Name servers must be specified on the command line since this is the server\n"
"  that will ultimately answer requests for NS information about this zone.\n"
"  If the name server is another host, you don't have to specify the IP\n"
"  address(es). If not specified on the command line, IP address(es) will be\n"
"  retrieved via a DNS query. Your resolver must work! Use the -N switch to set\n"
"  to SOA host name as well as the IP address reported for the dnsbls host.\n"
"  If not set in this manner, it will default to the host name.\n"
"  Multiple NS entries may be made (up to 5), each with multiple IP addresses\n"
"  (up to 10). IP address entries must follow their NS entry and appear before\n"
"  the next subsequent NS entry. Continuation lines may be used as a convenience\n"
"  if the line length gets too long\n"
"Note 2:\n"
"  MX (mail server) records are entered in the same manner as NS records.\n"
"  The -m (NN) option is specified on the command line following either the\n"
"  name entry, -n foo.bar.com, or address entry, -a xx.xx.xx.xx, if used. \n"
"Note 3:\n"
"  'kill -USR1 <dnsbls_PID>' to toggle logging on and off.\n"
"  If logging was not enabled at start this sets the '-l' flag\n"
"  If logging (-l | -v) are set this saves the value and turns off logging\n"
"  If logging is presently toggled off it restores the saved level (-l | -v)\n"
"Note 4:\n"
"  This sends log information to stdout rather than to syslog.  This option\n"
"  also implies and sets the -d option (Do NOT detach process).\n"
"Note 5:\n"
"  Entries contributed to the tarpit by remote DNSBL's are not normally\n"
"  reported by this DNSBL server. To do so would allow the addition of\n"
"  a blocked host to a network of contributing tarpit based DNSBL servers\n"
"  that could never be removed due to feed back between the servers.\n"
"  ENABLE this option only after careful consideration.\n";
