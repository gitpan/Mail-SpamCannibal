<font size='+1'>Login</font>
<p>
The administration process starts with the <b>login</b> process. Authentication and authorization use
a clear text process which should be protected by using an SSL enhanced web
server (https protocol). The session key is embeded in a cookie with an
configurable timeout (default 15 minutes) with no activity.

<font size='+1'>Password Administration</font>
<p>
SpamCannibal has a user friendly password adminstration front end. New
administrative users can be added and removed by any other admin or
optionally this feature can be disabled in the configuration file.
Password updates are straightforward and use the familiar OLD, double NEW
format.

<p>
Enter the IP address of the spam source and either paste in the spam record
from and email (headers and salient portions of the message) or type in
descriptive text that may be useful for the lookup client or to reference
other records in the same netblock that are spam sources. A button is
provided to add a single spam source or an entire CIDR/24 netblock.

<p>
The administration tools also provide a means to add entries that appear to
be from a remote DNSBL. While this may not be frequently used, it does allow
entry of a new or modified record to be made if needed. There are numerous
fields, all of which are self explanatory and which are described in detail in the
configuration file, sc_BlackList.conf

<font size='+1'>View a Database</font>
<p>
Each database used by SpamCannibal is viewable. The view screen displays 255
records per screen and can be scrolled by screen or by record number. The
primary display comes up showning the number of records in each database.
Clicking the database name produces the first page of the database showing
the IP address entries for each record. Clicking the IP address switches to
the <a href="#lookup ip">Lookup IP</a> screen for that particular record.

<font size='+1'>Administrative Lookup</a></font> (data found)
<p>
The administrative IP LOOKUP display provides information similar to the
public web LOOKUP display. There are two added features, the addition of
single host and CIDR/24 delete buttons and a display of other records in
the same CIDR/24 block so the record(s) can be easily removed from the
databases.

<p>
Spam can be added to the SpamCannibal database by email from your desktop.
Optionally, to protect the interface from malicious data entry, it can (and
should) be encrypted using PGP. Follow these simple steps:
<ol>
<li>Pop a new message window and address it to your SPAM mail client.
Messages addressed to this client will be caught and processed by the
sc_mailfilter.pl script.
<li>Expand the mail message to show the headers
<li>Copy and paste the headers and salient portions of the message into the
new message window.
<li>Encrypt the message
<li>Click send. It's DONE!
</ol>
