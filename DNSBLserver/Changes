Revision history for Perl extension Mail::SpamCannibal::DNSBLserver.

0.26  Wed Jun 23 12:55:01 PDT 2004
	fixed bug in ns.c that prevented 127.xx.xx.xx response TXT strings
	inserted by rc.dnsbls from being reported

	added zonefile.c and zonedump.c so that dnsbls can
	dump a zonefile to the dbhome directory on receipt
	of a SIG_USR2

	add script 'sc_zoneload' to load a BIND or 'dig' zone file
	into the database.

0.25  Tue Jun  8 16:29:39 PDT 2004
	updated rc.dnsbls v0.10 to fix bug for perl v5.8.3 
	where unshift does not work properly for default @_

0.24  Mon May 10 18:39:31 PDT 2004
	modified rc.dnsbls so that tarpit records forceably added from the
	config file (such at 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3, etc...) are tested first
	for existence and NOT added if they already exist. This preserves
	the data (time tag) on these records so that they can be used by
	other routines -- noteably, 127.0.0.2 which should always be present
	is used by sc_BLpreen.pl to determine it's own cron interval

0.23  Sat May  1 16:02:23 PDT 2004
	altered the comments at the beginning of DNSBLserver.pm

0.22  Mon Feb  9 15:56:51 PST 2004
	rewrite 'restart' logic in rc.dnsbls v0.8

0.21  Thu Oct 16 13:22:15 PDT 2003
	correct logic in ns.c to report 127.x.x.x codes in zone transfers

	add logic to main.c and ns.c to append the text of the IP address
	to standard TXT responses if the error message is default and 
	contains the character ? as in http://xxx.com?abc=

0.20  Sat Oct 11 08:28:02 PDT 2003
	modify util_pid.c and misc.c to include unlinkOK as in BDBaccess.
	update options.t to test correctly when default /var/run/dbtarpit 
	directory is not present

0.19  Wed Oct  8 11:36:59 PDT 2003
	add makefile entry to copy rc.dnsbls to install script file directory
	update test suites to accomodate libdbtarpit changes

0.18  Fri Oct  3 15:54:00 PDT 2003
	add code to generate child pid files and 
	for each task to remove it's own pid file on exit

0.17  Thu Sep 25 11:02:02 PDT 2003
	add Makefile constant MY_POD2TEXT

0.16  Wed Sep 24 14:08:42 PDT 2003
	modify source to be 32/64 bit independent
	modify ns.t to ignore poor implementations of dn_comp
	add os independent library calls/macros

0.15  Sat Sep 20 11:44:11 PDT 2003
	Add child wait status to tcp service so that the connection remains
	open until closed by the client or an alarm event.
	Add minimal IXFR service.

0.14  Thu Sep 18 15:13:15 PDT 2003
	place - holder

0.13  Thu Sep 18 15:13:15 PDT 2003
	incremental changes - place holder

0.12  Sun Sep 14 09:40:23 PDT 2003
	ns.c, rework the order of database interrogation for lookups
	of black list addresses. The old way produced three database hits 
	as the norm, this has been reduced to two.

0.11  Tue Sep  9 18:00:28 PDT 2003
	main.c -- modified the child network socket loop to fix a timing 
	problem when interrogating the dnsbls from the local host via bind.

	modify rc.dnsbls so that record 127.0.0.2 is 
	forceably added without user intervention.

0.10  Tue Sep  2 21:04:13 PDT 2003
	Revert -M option -- this turns out to be unneeded
	Add -N option for naming the localhost DNS object
	Correct error in mungemacros.c where buffer size constraint
	was MSGsize instead of IP_MAXPACKET
	Add lookup in the evidence file to ns.c. Evidence must be
	consulted before blcontrib to prevent non-reporting of 
	127.0.0.2 'A' records if they appear in both blcontrib and evidence.

0.09  Mon Sep  1 15:32:36 PDT 2003
	Add -M masquerade option to main.c, host_info.c
	When dnsbl is run on a virtual address, it must use the
	zone name and designated IP address from the command line

0.08  Tue Aug 12 15:53:46 PDT 2003
	Modify ns.c to disallow response codes outside
	the range of 127.0.0.3 => 127.255.255.255 for
	the blcontrib database. This will prevent
	feedback loops from developing among cooperating
	promiscious DNSBL servers

0.07  Sat Aug  2 22:25:05 PDT 2003
	set -P option for promiscious reporting

0.06  Wed Jul 30 09:59:09 PDT 2003
	change conflicting name Config.pm to SiteConfig.pm

0.05  Sat Jul 23 13:53:44 PDT 2003
	update to use libdbtarpit

0.04  Sat Jul 12 12:29:48 PDT 2003
	update to use bdbtarpit.c library

0.03  Thu Jul 10 07:37:26 PDT 2003
	add promiscious mode flag to
	enable reporting of tarpit
	additions by secondary DNSBL's

0.02  Sun Jul  6 17:00:06 PDT 2003
	correct malformed TXT records,
	add statistics for verbose logging,
	fix SIGCHLD bug in set_signals

0.01  Sat Jul  5 14:48:50 PDT 2003
	alpha release
