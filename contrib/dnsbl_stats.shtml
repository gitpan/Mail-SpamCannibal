<font size=+1><B>Spam Statistics Explained</b></font>
<p>
<b>SpamCannibal additions</b> - are the count of IP addresses that have been
registered by the SpamCannibal daemon the FIRST TIME they are seen as they
reach the application layer (mail daemon) and subsequently entered into the tarpit
by the cron job that generates these counts (SC additions). Multiple
connections from the same IP address are not counted.
WhiteList and Passed counts are for each message that is transported to the 
application level (mail daemon) on a repeating basis. Counts
shown for various DNSBL, BlackList, and CountryCode entries represent only
the first contact from a single IP address. Once an IP is entered into the
tarpit, it is not possible for it to reach the application level and be
counted since the connection to that host is blocked at the IP socket
transport level.
<p>
<b>MTA rejects</b> - are similar to above except that it is possible for some
rejected IP addresses to be counted multiple times between the time of first
contact and the time the cron job runs the script for SpamCannibal
additions. There is a count for each rDNS query made by the local MTA. For
example, if the spam/virus host sends a burst of messages during this time
window, then each message will be counted as it reaches the application layer. On
this pair of mail host, the excess count runs about 4% with the cron job
running every 20 minutes. Once the IP address has been added to the
SpamCannibal tarpit, it is no longer possible for the application layer to
see or count connection attempts for a host.
<p>
<b>Passed msg disposition</b> - these messages are further
filtered at this site by mimedefang and spamassassin to tag/remove
suspicious messages that have not been removed by virtue of listing in a
public DNSBL or the SpamCannibal database. The disposition is shown in the
last table. bad_hostname, bogus_hello, dynamic_IP, and invalid_recip messages are refused
(<i>bounced</i>) by the MTA. All other counted dispositions are forwarded to the SPAM account for
inspection and possible manual addition to the SpamCannibal database.
Messages not intercepted by filtering are delivered to the designated
receipient.
<p>
<b>Note</b>: additional messages may be rejected by the MTA's built in checks and
anti-relay provisions. Not all <b>Passed</b> messages that are not accounted
for in msg disposition are delivered to a receipient.
