This service does not block email access except for the IP addresses that have sent 
or relayed what we believe to be spam or other unsolicited email
directly to our MX hosts. Spam originating IP addresses are blocked only for
access to our mail servers, however, the database we use for that purpose is
freely availble for anyone to look at for use as they see fit. Use at your
own risk.

If you have been referred to this site because you appear to be blocked by some 
third party, speak to the adminstrators of the site you are trying to contact.

This service does not scan remote hosts or otherwise test remote sites. The
ONLY way you can get into our database is by sending spam to our mail
servers!
