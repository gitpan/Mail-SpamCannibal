Revision history for Perl extension Mail::SpamCannibal

0.86  Thu Dec 13 18:08:23 PST 2007
        increase the allowable number of nameservers
	in DNSBLserver v0.49 to 15

0.85  Wed Dec 12 12:26:31 PST 2007
	re-try on EXTRA_META tag syntax
	add time tags to -t zonedump print function

	remove $VERSION from CTest.pm modules in BDBaccess v0.22
	and DNSBLserver v0.48 and replace with $modVERSION

	required to complete the zonedump.

	add additional 'generic' patterns to sc_Blacklist.conf.example

	add EXTRA_META tag to Makefile.PM for CPAN engine
	thanks to Slaven Rezic for spotting it and providing the solution.

0.83  Wed Nov 21 13:06:35 PST 2007
	This release includes a major upgrade to the way in which
	IP's are added to an removed from the database. IP's whose
	PTR record match the generic form 'ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd' were
	targeted for optional inclusion in the permanent zonefile
	in rev 0.83. This concept has been expanded in this release
	to include automated addition to the zonefile (evidence
	database) of IP's that match a configurable regular 
	expression list for both mailfilter and BLcheck scripts.
	In addition, for the BLcheck script the additions can be
	alternatively made to the internal (non-zonefile blcontrib db)
	which are also removable by BLpreen script.

	Matching updates have been made to the helper routine
	Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon which prefilters connections to the
	mail system before BLcheck runs.
	
	updated sc_Blacklist.conf.example to change 
	sbl.spamhaus.org to zen.spamhaus.org
	removed relays.ordb.org, commented out bl.spamcop.net
	because it is way to aggressive.

	move dnsbl blocking check to after ordered delay
	in sc_mailfilter.pl

	disable restart wait period if in sub 'block4zonedump'
	when no zonedump pid file is found

	fix typo in public_html/incl/delist.incl

	subroutine xcidr24 is deprecated and removed, replaced
	with Xcidr24 that has an enhanced API

	GENERIC PTR record checking and CIDR24 checking
	is added to sub BLcheck in ScriptSupport v0.48

	configuration for sc_mailfilter.conf XCIDR24
	and sc_BLcheck GENERIC is enhanced and added
	respectively

	change ignor, regexp GENERIC detection to ignore case
	in ScriptSupport.pm v0.49

0.82  Tue Oct 30 11:25:04 PDT 2007  
	add bogon dnsbl to sc_BlackList
	add page to return PTR records for an IP address
	modify admin LOOKUP page to have PTR records button

	add expanded /24 spam recording for generic IP addresses
	see ScriptSupport::xcidr24 and comments in
	config/sc_mailfilter.conf.example

	updated sc_mailfilter.conf.example to support above

0.81  Sat Aug 18 14:45:27 PDT 2007
	in SMTPsend 0.05, correct documentation format error

	add admin 'delete list' function to provide a text box into which 
	a commented list of IP addresses can be entered for deletion,
	set wrap=off

	change ScriptSupport to return entire email sent to mail filter
	when required header match fails

0.80  Mon Jun 25 09:51:43 PDT 2007
	in ParseMessage 0.09 add sub to conditionally remove blank
	lines and trim the total number of lines in the message portion 
	of the spam sample if 'MSGMAX' is in the config file

	Automated lookups not allowed, click LOOKUP IP to continue.

	added 'block4zonedump' to ScriptSupport.pm v0.40
	add call to 'block4zonedump' to scripts
	sc_BLcheck.pl, sc_BLpreen.pl, sc_cleanup.pl

	zonedumps for very large zone files are perturbed by blcheck and
	blpreen IP additions and deletions. This addition to the script
	files allows them to block until the zonedump completes

0.78  Thu Oct 19 08:06:45 PDT 2006
	removed stub zone collection from contrib/zonedump.pl
	and ScriptSupport::dns2rblz v0.39 -- concept flawed

	ip addresses are not accumulated in the conversion to
	rbldnsd format for zone dumps.

0.75  Sun Sep 17 15:53:24 PDT 2006
	added soa minimum ttl switch for negative caching
	-s switch to DNSBLserver package 
	config/dnsbls.conf.sample, rc.dnsbls, main.c, data.c

NOTE: the first two of these must be installed MANUALLY

	./zonedump.pl -h	for help

	removed zone_cron.sh and zone_cron.pl

    In DNSBLserver v0.40
	add -C continuity flag, default '0', this is a BEHAVIOR CHANGE
	For very large zones and multiple daemons constantly adding
	and removing records, it is very difficult to get a contiguous
	zone dump where the starting and ending serial number is constant.
	Instead, re-sync the cursor to ignore BerkeleyDB's behavior of
	renumbering the records after an insert or delete. This allows
	a zone dump to proceed when record values that have already
	been read are deleted or inserts are made to the area the cursor
	has already transversed. More specifically, records ahead of the 
	cursor will appear in the zone file as they are transversed, records
	altered behind the cursor are not seen so effectively the zone is
	frozen for dump purposes at the instant the cursor transverse it.
	With "Continuity" set true, a single unperterbed snapshot of the
	database is dumped to the zone file. However, this method will fail
	if records are added or removed during the dump. The dump will
	automatically retry 3 times. The practical aspect of this change
	is that it is as if the zone was read a minute or two earlier in
	the case of similtaneous database updates.

	The old -C behavior is not desirable for large zones because it is
	not practical for the database to remain static long enough for 
	a complete zone dump. The behavior is deprecated, the -C flag is
	provided to retain the old behavior if for some strange reason
	you find it desirable.
	
	Removed redundant tests for 127.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1
	in ns.c and zonefile.c

	corrected and old bug in zonefile.c that dumped 127.0.0.1
	records to the zonefile


0.58  Fri Apr 15 15:57:36 PDT 2005
	In the DNSBLserver sub module:
	left pointer indicator '&' out of statement and 
	inadvertently commented out -L switch code in 0.38 release

0.57  Thu Apr 14 13:02:58 PDT 2005
	add test to sc_dbwatch to skip 'kill 9' during stop/restart
	when daemon is not running.

	DNSBLserver::zonefile.c
	add -L switch to limit the zonefile build transfer rate
	during a dnsbls zone dump. default 200,000 chars/sec

	extension in bad extension list and to accept strings that
	appear to be rDNS number failures that begin with 'mail'

	update contrib/mimedefang-filter sub 'filter_sender' to 
	include test for known_bad_domains

	update contrib/zone_cron.sh

  ##### NOTE: this change is not compatible for previous version of 
		public_html/incl/top.incl

		T_PTR
		T_ANY
	);
	Net::DNS::ToolKit qw(
		get16
	);
	when moving subroutines out of ScriptSupport.
	These are needed by runtime scripts that remain.
	Update to ScriptSupport v0.27

0.44  Wed Sep  1 15:35:37 PDT 2004
	moved from ScriptSupport v0.26 to Net::DNS::ToolKit::Utilities v0.20

0.43  not released
	in BDBaccess(v0.18)/CTest.xs and DNSBLserver(v0.30)/CTest.xs,
	update CTest.xs to eliminate use of "putchar" which conflicts
	with buffered/unbuffered use of IO in testing

	Tune DNAT documentation.
	Tune IPTABLES QUEUE documentation.
	Tune spam_report.cgi.example summary screen comments.

0.41  Sun Jun 27 09:04:56 PDT 2004
	DNSBLserver 0.29
	Added 'stop' variable for testing in main.c to intercept
	processing of the -T flag and stop STDOUT
	# Something in perl 5.8 does not allow the redirection of
	# STDOUT in an eval to a C program. The workaround is
	# simply to abort the call to 'main' just prior to issuing
	# the print statements since this is all tested elsewhere
	#

	DNSBLserver 0.28 - unreleased
	added time tag to zone file dump in dnsbls::zonefile.c

	oops! Fixed  PGP code in ScriptSupport::mailcheck v0.24 
	that had been commented out for debugging

0.38  not released to CPAN, but was on the web site for awhile
	minor (annoying) bug fixes... my bad :-(

	commented out several "use diagnostics" inadvertently remaining

	corrected test at line 1624 of ScriptSupport.pm v0.23 which failed 
	on undefined value, reversed order of test to detect undefined first

0.37  Wed Jun 23 19:42:20 PDT 2004
	Minor updates to the INSTALL document re: dnsbl installation

	corrected major typo in sc_session.pl v1.08 that pointed to the dbhome
	directory. The recent upgrade of IPTables... uncovered a missing
	variable in the SiteConfig hash that was duplicated in IPTables
	and did not (should not) exist in SpamCannibal SiteConfig.

	added test in cannibal.cgi v1.20 to detect missing query and ignore.

0.36  Wed Jun 23 13:10:52 PDT 2004
	updated the documentation in ./config/sc_Blacklist.conf
	to clarify problems with the timeouts in sendmail when using
	Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon

	removed duplicate use [module] qw(inet_aton inet_ntoa);

	dump a zonefile to the dbhome directory on receipt
	of a SIG_USR2

	add script 'sc_zoneload' to load a BIND or 'dig' zone file
	into the database.

0.35  NOT RELEASED -- distributed for testing, changes included above

0.34  Tue Jun  8 16:29:39 PDT 2004

	perl v5.8.3 where unshift does not work properly for default @_

	update sc_recoverdb.pl v1.01 to remove environment on an update

0.33  NOT RELEASED
	updated SMTPsend.pm v0.03 to properly include To: and From: headers
	instead of depending on the MTA to provide them. This is necessary
	so that spamassassian does not flag messages as spam. and... I
	overlooked it.

	updated ScriptSupport.pm v0.22 to check mode, uid, gid of one of 
	the db files to use for restoring db environment files.

	added utility sc_recoverdb.pl + documentation

0.32  Wed May 26 12:21:37 PDT 2004
	corrected a code typo in ScriptSupport.pm v0.21 that returned an undef 
	instead of the value expected -- not noticed because the expected 
	return was "false"

	updated internal call in ParseMessage.pm v0.06 sub _host2ip, to return
	255.255.255.255 for hosts where the gethostbyname lookup fails.
	This allows this forces all unknown hosts to fail certain test
	instead of matching a ''.

0.31  Sat May 22 10:45:37 PDT 2004
	updated DNSBLserver and BDBaccess packages to remove
	compiler dependent bug when extracting the C version 
	from the primary *.PM file

0.30  Mon May 10 19:34:54 PDT 2004
	update ScriptSupport v0.20 'BLpreen' to check the
	age of each tarpit entry and not bother to check
	blcontrib entries that are older than 5x the CRON interval
	for the BLpreen job. Last preen time is stored in the
	mandatory 127.0.0.2 entry in the 'tarpit' database

	Add the entry 'FORCE_PREEN' to the sc_BLacklist.conf file
	to force the old behavior.

	DNSBLserver v0.24, modified rc.dnsbls so that tarpit records
	forceably added from the config file (such at 127.0.0.2, 
	127.0.0.3, etc...) are tested first for existence and NOT 
	added if they already exist. This preserves the data (time tag) 
	on these records so that they can be used by other routines -- 
	noteably, 127.0.0.2 which should always be present is used by 
	sc_BLpreen.pl to determine it's own cron interval

0.29  Sat May  1 15:37:43 PDT 2004
	Moved Mail::SpamCannibal::PidUtil to Proc::PidUtil
	PidUtil remains but imports all its functions from

	  add dns_udpresp

0.21  Wed Jan  7 11:52:56 PST 2004

	and lookup page request actions.

	Add support to Whois and Lookup for country code and flag

0.18  Mon Oct 30 11:21:40 PDT 2003

	changed syslog call in rc.sc_dbwatch to match prototype

	squash a test bug in DNSBLserver

	modifiy sc_session.pl to access database directly for CIDR/24

	much too long.

	add remote commands to sc_remote.pl to support insEBLK, getC24 delBLK

0.16  Fri Oct 10 13:46:42 PDT 2003

	This release contains many bug fixes as well as some new features
	in the admin interfac.
	The following modules should be updated when installing this
	release:

		IPTables::IPv4::DBTarpit verion 0.22
		Net::DNS::Codes 0.08
		Net::DNS::ToolKit 0.14
	and the optional
		LaBrea::Tarpit version 1.20
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	add "add CIDR/24 and delete CIDR24" functions to admin tools

	corrected bad use of 'clean' function in sc_session.pl
	on non-strings such as netaddrs, addresses which end in '0'
	like 1.2.3.10 are truncated by 'clean'. This function SHOULD always
	be called on real strings or numbers, not string like objects such
	as netaddrs.

	add -x expires option to sc_cleanup.pl

	add dbjob_xxx utilities to ScriptSupport.pm 0.10 for db watcher

	add missing PidUtil qw(get_script_name) to sc_mailfilter.pl

	update test suites to accomodate libdbtarpit change

	add support for DB watcher to all daemons and scripts.
	each daemon and script creates a PID file in the db environment 
	directory and NOW removes the file on clean exit. The watcher script
	periodically checks whether the files described by the pid's are
	actually running and will signal the remaining jobs to exit, 
	remove and recreate the environment and restart the jobs.

	add administrative screen shots to document package

	correct sc_web.conf.example for missing entry to 
	support admin change password

	change nav.incl a href for 'docs' to 'docs/' to 
	for the web robots. This is comsmetic since the 
	href is not used anyway, but the robots see it.

	in cannibal.cgi, modify 'whois' and 'lookup' to insert the 
	IP address into the text box when the web interface is used.
	Correct typo *gt should be &gt

	update DNSBL list in sc_BlackList.conf

0.15  Tue Sep 30 10:01:08 PDT 2003

	modify spam_report.cgi to do a better job of extracting
	URL information from the DNSBL TXT records

	add onUnLoad function to spam_report.cgi to
	close popup window in multi-site environment.
	Requires LaBrea::Tarpit::Report v 1.09

0.14  Mon Sep 29 17:18:57 PDT 2003
	Changes are to these files ONLY

	deleted public/html/whois.cgi
	Makefile.PL
	public_html/spam_report.cgi.example
		(needs LaBrea::Tarpit::Report v 1.08)
		(found in LaBrea::Tarpit 1.18)

    Makefile.PL
	fixed install for $(SPAMCANNIBAL_HOME)/public_html/tmp
	to remove directory contents after chowning so that
	web daemon does not hang after a re-installation

    spam_report.cgi.example
	corrected variable name 'usr' should be 'url' in 
	public_html/spam_report.cgi

	correct the name of the 'dbtarpit' daemon displayed
	by 'spam_report.cgi'

	eliminate 'whois.cgi' as it does not work with MSIE in
	the pop-up window. Add workaround in LaBrea::Tarpit::Report
	which must be used with this version for all to work well.
