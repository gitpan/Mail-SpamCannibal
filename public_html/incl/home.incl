SpamCannibal blocks spam at the origination server and can be configured to 
block DoS attacks.
<br clear=left>&nbsp;
<br>
SpamCannibal uses a continually updated database containing the 
IP addresses of spam or DoS servers and blocks
their ability to connect using a TCP/IP tarpit,
<p>
SpamCannibal's TCP/IP tarpit stops spam by telling the spam server to send
very small packets. SpamCannibal then causes the spam server to retry sending 
over and over - ideally bringing the spam server to a virtual halt for a 
long time or perhaps indefinitely. SpamCannibal blocks spam at the source 
by preventing the spam server from delivering the messages from its currently 
running MTA process. This effectively eliminates the network traffic to your 
site because the spam never leaves the origination server. This same
strategy works equally well when SpamCannibal's tarpit daemon is configured
to defend against DoS attacks.
<p>
Widely deployed, SpamCannibal can help eliminate spam from the internet.
If enough threads on a spam server are captured, one of three things
happens: 

<ol>
<li>Good - the spam server runs slow and can't send out much spam to anyone
else, (If a thread is handling a bulk email list when it is captured, then
the entire list hangs.) 
<li>Better - the spam server crashes and doesn't send out any spam, 
<li>Best - every time a spam server starts, its process threads are quickly
captured by a community of cannibals and it never manages to send out any
spam.
</ol>
 
<p>
<font size="+1">SpamCannibal Benefits</font>
<ol>
<li>SpamCannibal can block spam email from entering your local network. 
This eliminates wasting time sorting through spam and keeps spam from wasting your network
bandwidth.
<br>
<li>A community of SpamCannibals can eat the spammers for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner.
With enough sites running SpamCannibal, the community of cannibals can block
spam directly
at the multiple spam sources.  Since SpamCannibal sports has its own DNSBL, a
community of cannibals can easily share the workload of spreading the
identity spammer IP addresses. 
This helps everyone and can reduce the overload on the network caused by spam.
<br>
<li>Once you have SpamCannibal running, you can begin to forget about
spam.  Once enough sites are running Spam Cannibal, everyone can begin to forget
about spam.
</ol>


<font size="+1">SpamCannibal is Free</font>
<p>
SpamCannibal is a free software toolkit to help stop DoS attacks, UBE (Unsolicited Bulk
Email), UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email), and other spam from reaching
your network and your mail servers.  SpamCannibal
is published under the GNU General Public License and is available for
download from CPAN.

<font size="+1">Using SpamCannibal</font>
<p>
SpamCannibal does not identify spam.  SpamCannibal uses a list of identified
spam sources (IP
addresses) to know what to block. SpamCannibal's network module continuously
adds the IP address of incoming connections to its database. From this
list, there are three ways to obtain a list of
spam sources:
<ol>
<li>Read the spam email that you receive to identify spam sources, and
simply mail the
offending spam to the SpamCannibal mail filter robot which will dutifully
strip out the sending
mail server host address and add it to SpamCannibal's tarpit database.
<li>Use a remote DNSBL to screen SpamCannibal's archive database of IP
connection addresses. SpamCannibal's BLcheck.pl
script does this for you automatically when run periodically from a cron
job.
<li>Setup an automated email filter to identify spam sources from the spam
email that you receive. Use SpamCannibal's tools to add these spam addresses
to the tarpit database. Extensive Perl tools are provided with the SpamCannibal distribution to
facilitate this.
</ol>

<font size="+1">SpamCannibal is Efficient</font>
<p>
SpamCannibal runs more than fast enough on a Linux 486 PC and uses very
little network bandwidth (because it is mostly ignoring connections). The SpamCannibal
tarpit daemon is stateless and consumes very few resources on its host and very little
bandwidth (1/2 byte per second per thread on average).
<p>

<font size="+1">Who are Potential SpamCannibal Users?</font>
<ol>
<li>Anyone running Linux and a mail server.

<li>If a few large ISPs were to install SpamCannibal, spam would rapidly
vanish.

<li>If internet router makers were to incorporate SpamCannibal into their
router software, spam would cease to exist.

<li>If network administrators were to install SpamCannibal (plus a suitable
spam filter) to protect their email servers, then spam would be banned from their networks.

<li>If security services were to install SpamCannibal, then ...

<li>You! If you are interested in helping to stop spam, read more about how
it works in the <a hrev="#top">FAQ</a>.

<font size="+1">If you think that you are being blocked...</font>
<p>
The ONLY way you can get into SpamCannibal's database is by sending spam or
virus ladened email to our mail servers!
<p>
SpamCannibal does not block email access except for IP addresses that have
sent or relayed what we believe to be spam or other unsolicited email directly to our email
servers.  Spam originating IP addresses are blocked ONLY for access to our mail servers,
however, the database we use for that purpose is freely available for anyone to look at
and use as they see fit.
<p>
If you have been referred to this site because you appear to be blocked by
some third party, speak to the administrators of the site you are trying to contact.
<p>
SpamCannibal does not scan remote hosts or otherwise test remote sites. The
ONLY way you can get into SpamCannibal's database is by sending unsolicited
email to our servers!
