></span>I
      have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the &quot;moral
      decay of society&quot; by selling the Banned CD. That may be, but I feel
      Strongly that you have a right to benefit from this hard-to-find
      information. So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD!
      With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends,
      enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet. You can track down
      old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make
      sure you get that next promotion! <br>
      Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall. You'll find
      addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. Need to
      disappear fast and never look back? No problem! Using the Banned CD, you
      will learn how to build a completely new identity. Obviously, the Powers
      That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD. They have threatened me with
      lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it
      immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access
      this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. Uncle Sam and your
      creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product! There must
      be a price on my head! <br>
      Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. And you can't
      buy freedom at your local Walmart. You will have the freedom to avoid
      creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS tax collectors, criminal indictments,
      your greedy ex-wife or ex-husband, and MUCH more!</b></p>
